"# Health-Insight" 
Health Insights App
Project Overview
The  Health Insights App is a straightforward mobile application built with React Native that helps users track and visualize basic health metrics. The app allows users to manually input key health data points (steps, sleep hours, water intake, mood) and provides  visualizations to help users understand patterns in their personal health data.
Key features include:

Manual entry of daily health metrics
Basic visualization of health trends over time
 insights based on user data patterns
Data export functionality
Privacy-focused design with local data storage

Fulfillment of Project Requirements
This project aligns with Track 1: Tools and interfaces for human/data-centered AI from the project proposal by:

Creating a mobile interface that helps users control and explore their personal health data
Giving users ownership over their health information through local storage and export options
Providing  visualization tools for basic data exploration
Implementing a mobile-first approach with React Native

The project fulfills the core requirement: "This tool should help users accomplish some kind of data-related action or some kind of data exploration task." It does this by enabling users to:

Input and track their personal health data (data-related action)
Visualize trends and patterns in their health metrics (data exploration)
Export their data for personal use (data control)

Human-Centric AI Topics Relevant to This Project
Despite its simplicity, this project incorporates several key human-centric AI principles:
1. Data Ownership

All data remains on the user's device by default
Users can export or delete their data at any time
No cloud storage or third-party data sharing

2. Simple Visualization and Transparency

Clear, easy-to-understand graphs and charts
No complex algorithms or black-box predictions
Direct relationship between input data and visualizations

3. Privacy by Design

Minimal data collection (only what the user manually inputs)
No unnecessary permissions required
Local storage only approach

4. User Agency

Users actively input their own data rather than passive collection
Full control over what metrics to track
Option to export data in standard formats

This streamlined approach ensures that the project can be completed in a short timeframe while still demonstrating understanding of human-centric AI principles and fulfilling the course requirements. The focus is on creating a functional, privacy-respecting tool that gives users control over their personal health data without unnecessary complexity.
