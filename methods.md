Methods
Application Architecture
Development of the Health Insights App utilized React Native to ensure seamless operation across iOS and Android platforms with native app performance. Each part of the app functions as a reeusable component which gives its architecture a modular structure. Here are the key building blocks:
1.	The app's navigation system uses React Navigation to implement bottom tabs for primary sections while stacks handle nested screens.
2.	The Storage Layer implements AsyncStorage for local data storage while custom utility functions manage data reading and deletion.
3.	The AI Processing Layer connects to Ollama, a local AI framework, to generate insights while keeping data on the user's network.
4.	UI Components with custom elements such as HealthMetricCard and LineChartComponent along with feedback tools are essential for delivering a consistent and intuitive user experience.
5.	The Theme System enables context-based theming that supports dark and light modes to provide visual comfort and accessibility.
Implementing Human-Centered Features
Human-centered design principles guided the implementation of multiple thoughtful features in the app.


1.	Participatory Features
•	Users take an active role in shaping their insights beyond merely providing data. Feedback System: The FeedbackDialog enables users to both rate insights and provide comments.
•	Context Annotations: The DataEntryForm gives users options to select "illness," "travel," or "stress" which assists in interpreting health data variations. Users can also write free-text notes.
•	Impact Assessment: The DataManagement screen displays the extent of user input contribution to their personal insights by linking data with feedback.

2.	Data Provenance Tracking
The application displays the origin of each insight for user clarity.
 
•	Confidence Indicators: A small confidence meter informs users about the reliability of each insight through the evaluation of data quantity and consistency.
•	AI Insight Transparency: Each AI-generated insight includes information about the data points used to generate it and the confidence level of the recommendation.
•	Export Metadata: The application provides the source origin for each data point during the export process.
The provided features enable users to make decisions through reliable information and relevant context.
3.	Ethical Data Handling
User privacy and data control are central.
•	Granular Controls: Users can remove specific data entries by selecting either their date or metric type.
•	Custom Retention Settings: Users have the option to set how long their data remains on their device.
•	Local Storage Only: The data remains on the user's phone and local network unless they decide to export it.
•	Privacy-Preserving AI: All AI processing occurs locally via Ollama, ensuring health data never leaves the user's network even for analysis.
•	Network Isolation: The Docker proxy architecture ensures that AI processing remains isolated within the user's private network.
Custom storage utilities, the Ollama proxy configuration, and a dedicated data management screen enable these options.
4.	Transparency Dashboard
Knowing how the app functions holds equal importance to its actual usage.
•	How It Works Screen: The How It Works Screen explains the process of data gathering, local AI processing, and insight creation.
•	Limitations Disclosure: The app's limitations disclosure section provides a straightforward explanation about its capabilities and limitations, including AI confidence levels.
•	AI Explainability: The app clearly explains which insights are generated by AI and provides context about how those insights are derived from the user's data.
•	Info Modals: Every info icon throughout the application links to small pop-up explanations for features displayed in context.
5.	Theme System Implementation
To support accessibility and comfort:
•	Theme Context Provider: Manages switching between light and dark modes.
•	Optimized Color Palettes: Both the light and dark themes feature robust contrast levels to enhance reading clarity.
•	Persistent Preferences: The app saves user theme preferences in AsyncStorage.
 
Development and Testing Approach
The app underwent an iterative development process that incorporated regular feedback to improve its features throughout its creation. Here's how the process unfolded:
1.	The development process began with core functionalities including data entry and storage capabilities plus charting features.
2.	I incorporated elements that focus on human needs by adding user feedback systems, transparency tools and ethical controls into the app.
3.	Ollama AI integration was implemented with a Docker-based proxy system to enable local AI processing of health data.
4.	The connection architecture was enhanced with automatic network configuration to simplify setup across different WiFi networks.
5.	The user interface received a polish update during which dark mode was integrated.
6.	Extensive testing was conducted to ensure the AI integration maintained the app's privacy-preserving principles and enhanced the user experience.
